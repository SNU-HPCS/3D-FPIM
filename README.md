# 3D-FPIM

This repository is the software-based simulator for the paper entitled 
'3D-FPIM: An Extreme Energy-Efficient DNN Acceleration System Using 3D NAND Flash-Based In-Situ PIM Unit'
published at MICRO 2022.

This repository includes three different source codes:
1. nand\_flash\_sim: the circuit-level simulator to evaluate the 3D NAND Flash memory and 3D-FPIM
2. compiler: the customized compiler to generate instruction trace for 3D-FPIM
3. retrain: the retraining framework for QA-CONV in 3D-FPIM (to be released)
